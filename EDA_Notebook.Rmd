### Complementary and Alternative Medical (CAM) and Spirituality, Religiosity Survey
The CAM and Spirituality, Religiosity survey was given to chronically ill patients who were randomly chosen from a patient database at a private medical clinic in Southampton, UK. To be a participant for the survey, individuals were required to (1) have recent treatment within the last three years, (2) have a diagnosis of either migraines, irritable bowel, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and (3) have an age greater than 18. Six hundred questionnaires were originally mailed to the patients, yet there was a response rate of 18.5%, with 111 successfully completed questionnaires. The survey aims to explore the impact of spirituality on health. The spiritual topics range from spiritual experiences, personal values, to private religious practices and more. As for the health topics, these range from mindfulness practices to current health issues. The following data is sourced from the Association of Religion Data Archives, www.theARDA.com, and was collected by principal investigators Niko Kohls, Harald Walach, and George Lewish. The original data set consists of 254 variables and 111 participants, but for better comprehension, the ARDA decided to add variables and responses to include 258 total variables and 130 respondents. However, for the purposes of this analysis, the variable count has been reduced to 13 variables. While this is a much shorter data set, the chosen variables create a more direct approach. A concise data set facilitates clearer interpretation of results without one being overwhelmed by excessive data. 

### Motivation
Understanding the relationship between spirituality and health is an important aspect in well-being. In medical environments, especially those dominated by Western medicine, spirituality's impact on health is often disregarded. With this data set, investigators are able to explore how spirituality affects various sectors of health and overall well-being. Via analysis, patterns or correlations can be linked. One could uncover whether certain spiritual practices or beliefs are associated with better mental health, reduced stress, or improved coping mechanisms. In return, these patterns are relevant to healthcare providers or therapists looking to integrate effective strategies into their treatments. Notably, findings could influence policies related to holistic healthcare approaches that acknowledge the role of spirituality in patient well-being.

### Defining Variables
The original data set consists of 130 responses to 258 variables. Narrowing the focus for a more direct approach, 13 variables were chosen instead. Three categories were made in order to create a distinction between these chosen variables. The categories are as follows: spirituality/religious, health effects, and personal data. 

* For the **spiritual and religious** category, the following variables are as defined: 
    * *belgdwth* refers to the survey question "I believe in a God who watches over me",
    * *prvtpry* refers to "How often do you pray privately in place?",
    * *relpersn* refers to "To what extent do you consider yourself a religious person?"
    * *sprtprsn* refers to "To what extent do you consider yourself a spiritual person?". 
* The **health effects category** contains both physical and psychological effects. These variables are:
    * *DISTRS11*: poor appetite,
    * *DISTRS23*: nausea or upset stomach, 
    * *DISTRS37*: feeling weak in parts of your body, 
    * *DISTRS04*: feelings others are to blame for most of your troubles,
    * *DISTRS16*: feeling lonely,
    * *DISTRS53*: the idea that something is wrong with your mind. 
* As for the personal data category, the variables chosen are:
    * *gender*: female or male, 
    * *mrtlstus*: marital status (single, married, divorced,  or widowed), 
    * and *denom*: denomination. 


#### Rationale for Selecting Variables
Given the abundant amount of original variables, the elected variables were selected carefully. The variables *belgwth*, *prvtpry*, *relpersn*, and *sprtprsn* are variables that were chosen to determine how spiritual or religious a participant might be: 

* The variable *belgwth* indirectly questions the participant if they believe in a greater existence and if the participant believes that greater existence is watching them. 
* The variable *prvtpry* aims to see how religious a participant actually is outside of church. Oftentimes, individuals want a certain image of themselves to be displayed to the public, but private practices are a different topic.
* The variables *relpersn* and *sprtprsn* are a self ranking and sets how the participant views themselves on a scale from "not at all" to "very". 

The next set of variables relate to a participant's current health issues. They can be further split into physical and psychological effects. 

* The physical symptom variables were poor appetite (*DISTRS11*), nausea or upset stomach (*DISTRS23*), and feelings of weakness in one's body (*DISTRS37*). These variables were selected as they directly related to the requirements to the survey study of having irritable bowel or chronic fatigue syndrome. While the third indicator was migraines, the statements related to them were not as direct as these. So for the sake of a focused analysis, irritable bowel and chronic fatigue syndrome were preferred. 
* The psychological health effects chosen were feelings others were to blame for most of one's troubles (*DISTRS04*), feelings of loneliness (*DISTRS16*), and feelings that something is wrong with one's mind (*DISTRS53*). *DISTRS04* was chosen to see if participants would blame their problems on an entity rather than themselves while *DISTRS16* and *DISTRS53* were elected to see if the level of religiosity or spirituality affected how lonely one was or if they felt something was genuinely wrong with them. 

The last set of variables were demographic variables to get to know the data set population. These variables include gender, marital status, and denomination. Ultimately, these variables were chosen to illuminate any findings on the health relationships between the spiritual and physical in hopes to offer a shorter but to some extent holistic approach. 

(While creating our new dataset, we renamed certain variables for clarity during data analysis as follows: 

* *belgdwth* to *godwatches*
* *DISTRS11* to *poor_appetite*,
* *DISTRS23* to *nausea*, 
* *DISTRS37* to *weakness*, 
* *DISTRS04* to *blameothers*,
* *DISTRS16* to *lonely*,
* *DISTRS53* to *mindwrong*.)

### Getting to Know the Participants
#### Differences in Gender
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(camdata_clean, aes(x=gender, fill = gender))+ 
  geom_bar()+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue4", "darkred"))+ 
  labs(title = "Gender Count in Survey Responses", x="Gender", y="Count", fill="Gender")
```

A notable gender disparity can be observed within the data set. The survey responses were predominantly from women with 112 respondents, whereas men represented a much smaller group with only 17 respondents. This stark difference in sample sizes raises important considerations while interpreting the findings in relation to gender. An important concept to this disparity may be due to voluntary response bias. The imbalance suggests that women may be more inclined to participate in surveys regarding spirituality, religiosity, or health in comparison to men. Notably, the small number of male respondents limits the ability to generalize findings across the general population. However, despite the imbalance, the data still provides valuable insights into how spirituality and religiosity influences health.

#### Marital Status
```{r}
ggplot(camdata_clean, aes(x=mrtlstus, fill = mrtlstus))+ 
  geom_bar()+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("chartreuse3", "cornflowerblue", "brown", "aquamarine3"))+ 
  labs(title = "Marital Status Distribution in Survey Responses", x = "Status", y = "Count", fill="Marital Status")
```

The marital status of an individual can provide valuable insights into how personal relationships and social structures influence or interact with an individual's spiritual beliefs and practices. Married individuals generally experience higher levels of social support, which can positively influence their overall well-being. Spirituality and religiosity can play a role in strengthening marital bonds and providing emotional and practical support. This suggests that marital status impacts physical health outcomes. This suggests that marital status impacts physical health outcomes. The survey responses reflect that 53% respondents are married, 27% are single, and 19% are divorced, with 1 respondent being widowed. These percentages generally reflect marriage status within the UK in 2021 for single and married populations. Our sample contains a higher proportion of divorced participants and a lower proportion of widowed participants compared to the national average. Average age of respondents and accessibility of the survey to older populations may have affected the response rate of widowed participants. In general, we can assume that our sample is reflective of the marital status across the population. 

#### Denomination
```{r}
ggplot(camdata_clean, aes(x=denom, fill = denom))+ 
  geom_bar()+ 
  labs(title = "Religious Denomination Distribution", x = "Denomination", y = "Count", fill="Denomination")+ 
  theme(axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.9))
```

  labs(title = "Self-Rated Religious Level", x = "Level of Religiousity", y = "Count", fill="Religiousity Scale")+

### Analysis

#### Quantifying Health
We are interested in the intersection of religious and spiritual practices with physical and psychological health. Currently, all variables measuring health (both physical and psychological) are coded as factor variables, with levels "Not at all", "A little bit", "Moderately", "Quite a bit", and "Extremely" for rating the severity of these symptoms. In order to perform a detailed statistical analysis regarding the relationship between health and spirituality, we must first **quantify health symptoms** reported by these patients. This will allows us to measure "health" across different groups while still maintaining the integrity of survey responses. Quantifying health symptoms allows us the calculate the "average" health across groups and gives us a wider range of plots in order to assess our data. In order to quantify data, we must convert these factor variables into numerical variables. For the purposes of converting these variables, 0 will represent "Not at all", 1 will represent "A little bit", 2 will represent "Moderately", 3 will represent "Quite a bit", and 4 will represent "Extremely". A lower "health score" will correlate with a person reporting less severe symptoms, or a "healthier" respondent. 

```{r}
#physical health symptoms - appetite, nausea, weakness
  #appetite
camdata_clean$poor_appetite_num <- camdata_clean$poor_appetite
levels(camdata_clean$poor_appetite_num) <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
camdata_clean$poor_appetite_num <- as.numeric(as.character(camdata_clean$poor_appetite_num))

  #nausea
camdata_clean$nausea_num <- camdata_clean$nausea
levels(camdata_clean$nausea_num) <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
camdata_clean$nausea_num <- as.numeric(as.character(camdata_clean$nausea_num))

  #weakness
camdata_clean$weakness_num <- camdata_clean$weakness
levels(camdata_clean$weakness_num) <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
camdata_clean$weakness_num <- as.numeric(as.character(camdata_clean$weakness_num))

  #physical (combined)
camdata_clean$physical_health <- rowMeans(cbind(camdata_clean$poor_appetite_num, camdata_clean$nausea_num, camdata_clean$weakness_num), na.rm=T)


#psychological health symptoms - blameothers, lonely, mindwrong
  #blameothers
camdata_clean$blameothers_num <- camdata_clean$blameothers
levels(camdata_clean$blameothers_num) <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
camdata_clean$blameother_num <- as.numeric(as.character(camdata_clean$blameothers_num))

  #lonely
camdata_clean$lonely_num <- camdata_clean$lonely
levels(camdata_clean$lonely_num) <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
camdata_clean$lonely_num <- as.numeric(as.character(camdata_clean$lonely_num))

  #mindwrong
camdata_clean$mindwrong_num <- camdata_clean$mindwrong
levels(camdata_clean$mindwrong_num) <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
camdata_clean$mindwrong_num <- as.numeric(as.character(camdata_clean$mindwrong_num))

  #psychological (combined)
camdata_clean$psych_health <- rowMeans(cbind(camdata_clean$blameothers_num, camdata_clean$lonely_num, camdata_clean$mindwrong_num), na.rm=T)


#health (combined) - combining health scores of both physical and psychological symptoms
camdata_clean$health_total <- rowMeans(cbind(camdata_clean$physical_health, camdata_clean$psych_health), na.rm=T)
```

#### Physical Health vs. Psychological Health
Before delving into the relationship between spirituality and health, we should first measure whether there is a correlation between physical and psychological health. This will help us with our future analysis in comparing the physical and psychological health of different subgroups when assessing the impact of spiritual and religious practices. While physical and psychological symptoms are distinct, physical maladies can certainly lead to a lower quality of life and feelings of loneliness and helplessness. We predict at least a small correlation, if not a significant relationship between a person's physical and psychological health. 

```{r}
##physical vs psychological health
ggplot(camdata_clean, aes(x=physical_health, y=psych_health))+
  geom_point(position="jitter")+
  geom_smooth(color="blue4")+
  labs(x="Physical Health Score", y="Psychological Health Score", title="Psychological vs. Physical Health in Survey Responses")
```
[Analysis - they are correlated. we expect this relationship to persist in our further analysis when introducing spirituality and religion.]

#### Spiritual vs. Religious - Health Effects
Two of our variables assess the self-ranking of respondents on how religious and how spiritual they consider themselves to be. We used this as a benchmark to assess the "religiousness" and "spirituality" of respondents. [Continue here.]

```{r}
##spiritual with psych vs. religious
##spiritual with physical vs. religious
##camdata_clean %>%
  filter(relprsn=="Moderately religious" | relprsn=="Very religious") %>%
summary(camdata_clean$relprsn)
##still figuring out
```
[Analysis here]

#### How Does Marital Status Affect Health Symptoms? 
As we discussed previously, the marital status of an individual can reflect an individual's spiritual beliefs and practices, providing insight into a person's emotional and physical well-being. Married individuals tend to place more value of spiritual and religious beliefs, which in turn can strengthen marital bonds and introduce central values within couples. As we assessed prior, our survey responses contains a good mix of single, married, and divorced respondents representative of UK populations. By assessing the relationship between marital status and health, we are given insight as to how one's emotional support system can predict health and well-being. 
```{r}
##marital status vs health
camdata_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mrtlstus, y=health_total, fill=mrtlstus))+
  geom_bar(stat="summary", fun="mean")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("chartreuse3", "cornflowerblue", "brown", "aquamarine3"))+ 
  labs(x="Marital Status", y="Average Health Score", title="Average Health Score by Marital Status")
```
[Analysis - in terms of general health, marriage predicts a lower average health score (aka better ratings.]

##### Marital Status and Health Symptoms - Physical vs. Psychological
We've established that marital status predicts the severity of health symptoms, with married individuals scoring much lower in their average health score. However, the measurement we used, the "average health score" factors in all physical and psychological symptoms we previously selected - poor appetite, nausea, weakness, feeling others are to blame, feelings of loneliness, and feeling that something is wrong with one's mind. While marriage provides a significant emotional support system that might alleviate feelings of loneliness and blame, marriage is not directly linked to helping physical symptoms like nausea and weakness. Comparing how marital status predicts the severity of physical vs. psychological symptoms can provide insight into how the religious and spiritual aspects of marriage and partnership affect health symptoms. 

```{r}
##marital status vs health (physical/psych)
physvsmrtl <- camdata_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mrtlstus, y=physical_health, fill=mrtlstus))+
  geom_bar(stat="summary", fun="mean")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("chartreuse3", "cornflowerblue", "brown", "aquamarine3"))+
  labs(x="Marital Status", y="Physical Health Score", title="Physical Health Score by Marital Status")

psychvsmrtl <- camdata_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mrtlstus, y=psych_health, fill=mrtlstus))+
  geom_bar(stat="summary", fun="mean")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("chartreuse3", "cornflowerblue", "brown", "aquamarine3"))+
  labs(x="Marital Status", y="Psychological Health Score", title="Psychological Health Score by Marital Status")

ggarrange(physvsmrtl, psychvsmrtl,
          ncol=2, nrow=1)
```
[Analysis - not much difference between physical and psychological health. the correlation between physical and psychological health persists. not sure whether this is because this correlation between physical and psych is strong of because marriage helps alleviate physical symptoms. "Further analysis on how these respondents engage in spiritual/religious practices and how their marriage discourages/enables these rituals is needed." ]

### Conclusion
