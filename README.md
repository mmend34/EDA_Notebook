# Religiosity and Spirituality in Medicine
This project is a part of the Exploratory Data Analysis research project for ENDGRD302W: Technical Writing at Emory University.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Introduction and Rationale
Exploring the relationship between religion, spirituality, and health is driven by an innate curiosity about how these three aspects of human life influence both physical and mental well-being. As individuals seek a connection through spiritual practices and religious beliefs, understanding how these dimensions contribute to health outcomes can offer valuable insights into a holistic approach to care. This research project aims to uncover how spirituality and religious involvement impact health and how or why healthcare should implement policies with spirituality as its own sector. If research can demonstrate that spiritual and religious practices positively influence health outcomes, healthcare providers might incorporate these elements into treatment plans, offering support that resonates with patients’ values and beliefs. This could in turn lead to more personalized care that addresses not only physical symptoms but also emotional and spiritual well-being. For patients, this means improved health outcomes, greater satisfaction with their care, and a more supportive healing environment that respects and integrates their personal beliefs and practices.

## Project Description
The CAM and Spirituality, Religiosity dataset is from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) which studies the effect of spirituality on health based on various factors on chronically ill patients from a private medical clinic in Southampton, UK. Some of the correlations include spiritual and meditative practice, spiritual experiences, personal values, spiritual coping, and religious support. Topics for health measures include mindfulness when facing current problems. 

The principal investigators Niko Kohls, Harald Walach, and George Lewish sent out questionnaires to a randomized population of patients who met the following three criteria: undergone treatment within a 3 year mark, older than the the age of 18, and had a diagnosis of either migraines, irritable bowel, or chronic fatigue syndrome. The respondents consisted of 71 cases with chronic fatigue (65%), 29 (27%) individuals with an irritable bowel syndrome as well as 9 (8%) patients suffering from migraines, totaling to 130 respondents. The survey questions focused on the impact of patients' spirituality and their overall physical health. The spiritual topics range from spiritual experiences, personal values, to private religious practices and more. As for the health topics, these range from mindfulness practices to current health issues. The final data set consisted of 258 total variables, from 254 initially, and 130 respondents for a better understanding of the subject matter. For our project’s more focused analysis, the variable count has been reduced to 13 variables. By concentrating on the factors that would best describe our sample and their relationship with religion/spiritual practices, such as marital status, religious/ spiritual self-ranking, and their physical and mental health, we developed a more direct approach towards understanding the correlation between spirituality and health. 

Within the project, several blockers and challenges arise due to the survey format, sample demographics, and variable limitations. The survey format, while comprehensive, may lead to response biases or incomplete data, potentially skewing results. Notably, the sample is predominantly female, which could limit the generalizability of findings and obscure gender-specific differences in the relationship between spirituality and health. Additionally, the dataset’s initial richness of 254 variables was significantly narrowed down to 13 for focused analysis. This reduction may overlook important nuances and interactions between variables, impacting the depth and applicability of the results. The concentration on a smaller set of variables, though necessary for clarity, poses the risk of omitting critical factors that could provide a more holistic understanding of the complex interplay between spirituality and health. These challenges emphasize the need for careful interpretation and consideration of potential biases in the analysis.
