# Religiosity and Spirituality in Medicine
This project is a part of the Exploratory Data Analysis research project for ENDGRD302W: Technical Writing at Emory University.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Introduction and Rationale
Exploring the relationship between religion, spirituality, and health is driven by an innate curiosity about how these three aspects of human life influence both physical and mental well-being. As individuals seek a connection through spiritual practices and religious beliefs, understanding how these dimensions contribute to health outcomes can offer valuable insights into a holistic approach to care. This research project aims to uncover how spirituality and religious involvement impact health and how or why healthcare should implement policies with spirituality as its own sector. If research can demonstrate that spiritual and religious practices positively influence health outcomes, healthcare providers might incorporate these elements into treatment plans, offering support that resonates with patients’ values and beliefs. This could in turn lead to more personalized care that addresses not only physical symptoms but also emotional and spiritual well-being. For patients, this means improved health outcomes, greater satisfaction with their care, and a more supportive healing environment that respects and integrates their personal beliefs and practices.

The CAM and Spirituality, Religiosity dataset is from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) which studies the effect of spirituality on health based on various factors on chronically ill patients from a private medical clinic in Southampton, UK. Some of the correlations include spiritual and meditative practice, spiritual experiences, personal values, spiritual coping, and religious support. Topics for health measures include mindfulness when facing current problems. This dataset was chosen due to the depth and breadth of sampling questions on patient meditative and spiritual practices, totaling to 258 distinct variables. This diversity enables us to isolate distinct applications of faith-based practice and examine their individual effect in alleviating chronic health symptoms. Recognizing the personalized nature of spiritual care, we seek to define and provide specific examples of religious and spiritual care that improve patient outcomes to implement into healthcare and patient treatments.

Using R and RStudio, we examine the correlation between an individual’s self-ranked level of religiosity/spirituality with the severity of their physical and mental health symptoms. Additionally, we investigate the effect of specific faith-based practices in improving chronic health outcomes by enhancing quality of life and offering spiritual support. Specifically, we isolate measures of an individual's relationship to religion and spirituality and determine how they predict severity of physical and psychological symptoms. Inferential statistics and correlation tests conducted in R will help us numerically define relationships between variables.

Within the project, several blockers and challenges arise due to the survey format, sample demographics, and variable limitations. The survey format, while comprehensive, may lead to response biases or incomplete data, potentially skewing results. Notably, the sample is predominantly female, which could limit the generalizability of findings and obscure gender-specific differences in the relationship between spirituality and health. Additionally, the dataset’s initial richness of 254 variables was significantly narrowed down to 13 for focused analysis. This reduction may overlook important nuances and interactions between variables, impacting the depth and applicability of the results. The concentration on a smaller set of variables, though necessary for clarity, poses the risk of omitting critical factors that could provide a more holistic understanding of the complex interplay between spirituality and health. These challenges emphasize the need for careful interpretation and consideration of potential biases in the analysis.
